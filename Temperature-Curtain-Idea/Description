The idea here is a curtain controlled by a motor. Can also be applied to shutters. Once the temperature in the room reaches a certain threshold the motor starts moving to close the curtain. This is done so that rooms can stay cooler in warmer temperatures. This works especially well in countries like Germany where some days in the summer can get really hot but people generally don’t have air-condition. When people are outside the house, the curtain can automatically keep the heat out of rooms. When it gets colder throughout the day the curtain opens again (this could be made time dependent, because you wouldn’t want the curtain to open in the middle of the night).
