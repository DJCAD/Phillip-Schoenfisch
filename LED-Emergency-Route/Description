The idea is to have an extension for fire alarms. Once the alarm goes off the LEDs light the way to the nearest exit. 
This is applicable to the home and may help orientation in thick smoke.
The LED could come in the form of strips. This could make it possible to lay out emergency routes in older buildings or even in places like caves, tunnels, excavation sites, etc.
The idea was inspired by the emergency lights that turn on in airplanes if smoke develops in the cabin.
A connection to the alarm or a smoke sensor would have to be made.
