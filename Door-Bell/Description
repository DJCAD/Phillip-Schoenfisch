The idea is to have a handphone application to which you can add the location of your good friends/family's home.
The application then enables you to ring their connected doorbell once you've entered the area, 
or whenever you choose to depending on the options set.

This allows the home owner to come down before the person has arrived. 
This can be better than simply texting/calling the handphone of the other person, since it may be on silent/charging, etc.

The app could also allow access for delivery services, which could speed up their service.
