This folder contains the dust app mockup, dustapp.pptx. The buttons can be touched on touchscreens in presentation mode but the resolution
that of the Surface Pro 4 in portrait. It may not work on all devices.

Thedustpad.pptx is an early presentation of the idea I gave to class. It was meant for brainstorming purposes as I was not aware
of the Sharp Dust Sensor at the time.
