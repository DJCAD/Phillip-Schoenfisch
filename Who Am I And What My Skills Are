Iâ€™ve just finished a gap year in which I taught myself design before entering DJCAD.
My mind is always racing with new ideas. My design thinking has been more intuitive so far and is now being given structure through 
the master. I like the idea of turning my emotions and inner workings into designs as symbols, but the master has also opened my eyes
to using design to tackle the problems of our times. I work best through iteration, starting with a rough idea and continually 
refining it, something that I have been doing with music, art and level design since childhood.
